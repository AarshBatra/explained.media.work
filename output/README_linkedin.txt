Air pollution is the world’s largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death, which disproportionately harms residents of low and middle-income countries. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 is 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³). 

The life expectancy of an average person on the planet would have extended by 2.3 years had the air pollution from 2021 levels been lowered to match the WHO guideline, according to the satellite-derived PM2.5 data from the 2023 Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) Annual Report. That said, its important to note that this burden is not spread evenly throughout the world—nor are the basic resources necessary to build stronger policies to tackle it.
